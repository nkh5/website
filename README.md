Personal Portfolio Website - Chimdibam Clone
This project is a functional and responsive clone of the personal portfolio website found at chimdibam.co. It is built with clean HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, providing a perfect template for developers and designers to showcase their work.

Features
Minimalist & Modern Design: A sleek, dark-themed UI focused on typography and white space, inspired by the original site.

Fully Responsive: The layout seamlessly adapts to all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

Smooth Animations: Implements subtle on-scroll fade-in animations and a sticky header for an enhanced user experience.

Organized Codebase: The project is structured into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for maintainability.

How to Use
Follow these steps to customize and launch your own version of this portfolio.

1. Download the Files
Start by getting the project files (index.html, style.css, and script.js) onto your computer.

2. Customize Your Content
Open index.html in a text or code editor. You will need to replace the placeholder content with your own information:

Text: Change "Your Name," project titles, descriptions, and the "About Me" section.

Links: Update the social media and project links to point to your profiles and work.

Images: Replace the placeholder image URLs (from placehold.co) with URLs to your own project images and personal photo. You can upload your images to your GitHub repository and use the links from there.

3. Deploy with GitHub Pages (Free)
Create a new repository on your GitHub account.

Upload the index.html, style.css, and script.js files to this new repository.

In your repository, navigate to Settings > Pages.

Under the "Build and deployment" section, select "Deploy from a branch."

Choose the main branch (or master) and keep the folder as /root. Click Save.

Your website will be live in a few minutes at a URL like: https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/.

You now have a clean, professional portfolio to share with recruiters and colleagues.
